# 🐭 Idle Clicker Game

Welcome to my idle clicker game — built with **Vite** and entirely **vibe coded in Cursor**.  
Yes, it’s one of _those_ games. You click things. Numbers go up. Time disappears. 😌

> ⚠️ This README was also vibe coded because I don’t have time for documentation. Touch grass if you need a manual.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Vite** – For speed and zero config energy.
- **Cursor** – AI pair programming that actually vibes.
- **Whatever JS/TS/React hybrid felt right** – You know how it goes.

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then head to http://localhost:5173 and let the clicking begin.

🌀 Gameplay
Click things.

Automate things.

Numbers go brrr.

That’s it. That’s the game.

🧠 Dev Notes
This was built in a zone fueled by caffeine, lo-fi, and vibes.
Everything came together with Cursor’s help and very little regard for planning.

🔮 Roadmap (if I feel like it)
Save/load support

Offline gains

Prestige and resets

UI polish (maybe)

Possibly more rodents
